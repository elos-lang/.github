## Build HTML emails, but without the torture

Crafting HTML emails has always been a pain—inline styles, inconsistent 
rendering across email clients, and a sea of outdated quirks to navigate. 
ELOS changes that.

ELOS is a declarative, developer-friendly language designed specifically for 
building responsive, accessible, and beautifully branded HTML emails. Forget about 
manually wrestling with tables and obscure CSS hacks—ELOS abstracts the complexities, 
letting you focus on design and content while ensuring rock-solid email compatibility.

### With ELOS, you get:
✅ Simplified Syntax – Write structured, readable code that compiles into bulletproof HTML.<br />
✅ Smart Defaults – No more worrying about missing styles or broken layouts.<br />
✅ Reusable Components – Build once, reuse everywhere.<br />
✅ Responsive by Default – Emails that look great on any device, without extra hassle.<br />

Say goodbye to email development torture and hello to ELOS.
